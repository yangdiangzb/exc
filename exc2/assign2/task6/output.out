have an html file which has a jar file included in it as an When ever i am opening the html file its getting too much time to load the there any way by which i can reduce this loading the applet loading
package name is not the project the package name is the From to change the to your application package in from Hello World the project name is but the package name is this application had a it would be stored at see how it is for the other applications you can start your On the menu bar you have your name think it stands for Android Virtual On mine it s From command have to replace 5554 by whatever port you are you have the command prompt you can you will see that eveything is in a form of a package info
like this is very jQuery animateCount function var steps self if to steps from function if 0 to 0 from counter time just will count to 1 to with the number incrementing every 100 The interval is an optional 3rd
for the InterlockedExchangePointer a the parameters are 64 bits and the Target parameter be aligned on the function will behave On a the parameters are 32 bits and the Target parameter be aligned on for and the program will on 32bits and 64bits does the following structure provide pointers which are by InterlockedExchangePointer on any or running architecture without code Foo enum count 3 T suppose that if a single pointer is aligned on 64bits also aligned on 32bits even if there is a padding if running on InterlockedExchangePointer and pointer

came across the same My 32 bits png image looked horrible in a What I did is convert my png file to the format used and then added it to the I did is set True to make the DataGridViewImageCell treat my image as an that did it for The icons look good
it possible to merge several JavaScript files being used on a site into looking to do this to minimize server loads by forcing only one This way I can keep my JavaScript organized into separate files and still have JavaScript files together on the fly in
can implement a custom as a bridge between your domain and Spring Then you supply Spring Security with it as follows Spring Security your implementation
question is cool examples have you seen that generate music dynamically by the Either based on samples with an interesting by sound synthesis or similar any serious sound synthesis been done yet generating sine waves dynamically and or are there still inherent technological boundaries to do are your general thoughts about generating music dynamically on the Is any form of more involved generation still too Be it using JavaScript or all my efforts have been far too and not a very satisfying experience for the Music and Sound synthesis
will need to add some settings to your code in order to be able debug your serialization Please consult the following article on Common Problems with the there is a neat trick there that will keep the files created in your temp folder so you can see what is normal XmlSerializer deletes the files for the serialization when they are no longer is an undocumented diagnostics which will instruct XmlSerializer deletes to leave files on your You can set switch in your this switch present in the source files in your temp If you working on a computer running 2000 or the default for the temp directory is and for applications running under the The files are easy to because they have very odd randomly generated something XmlSerializerPreCompiler sets diagnostics so you can the files to inspect the lines which the reported compilation errors in or Visual
the driver itself is individuals cursor so you reliably process the data in the way possibility would be to have a single thread that iterates over the handing them off to any number of worker threads for the actual
number generator can of course be used outside of by simply storing the current generator value along with the probabilistic pure data structure and updating it when constructing modified The downside to this is that the PRNG will be more obviously deterministic than in an impure since nothing outside of the single data structure will update If only the statistical properties matter this poses no but could be cause for concern the other hiding an impure PRNG is arguably a justified use of as in This blatantly violates referential but only to the extent that the PRNG will return inconsistent is the whole Caution is still as the compiler may make incorrect assumptions about the code because it neither approach is terribly Using is unsatisfying and potentially Threading a PRNG state is but imposes a strict sequencing on any computations that use Neither safety nor laziness are relinquished lightly by Haskell programmers rightly and of course data structures restricted to are of limited to answer part of your why Haskell programmers are likely to avoid such for Haskell can deal such I would suggest that this is wrong question to it really comes down to is that many data structures and algorithms assume optimize an strict and while certainly to implement these in Haskell rarely because ignoring the internal using them imposes on your code a structure and approach that is very much not because Haskell violates those implicit performance is often degraded badly thing to realize is that and data structures are a not an rarely the case that a single specific implementation is required is generally certain Finding data that offer the desired characteristics while also being idiomatic Haskell is almost always a better and is likely to perform better than trying to cram a strict imperative peg into a lazy functional mistake is perhaps most commonly found in the subset of programmers who never met a problem they solve with a hash but the habit is easy to fall into for many of The correct approach is to thinking do I implement this solution in but instead is the best way to solve my problem in You might be surprised how often the answers I know I often

merge sort based on the size of the processor with the blocks being divided between the processors comes to merge stage could be done by splitting the merge into n bits with each processor starting to merge the blocks from the correct offset into the have not tried writing the relative speed of CPU cache and main is not that far off the relative speed of RAM and Tape as the time the merge sort was maybe we should start using merge sorts
supports CF It shares the codebase with Rebex FTP which is maintained since I guess it is probable quite stable for example Microsoft licensed this component and is using it in Visual Studio 2010 for web Source code
you only have the one website on this you need a virtual Just set the DocumentRoot correctly and away you Also make sure Apache is listening on all IP addresses that work for from your command prompt see what you get back you should get your default
